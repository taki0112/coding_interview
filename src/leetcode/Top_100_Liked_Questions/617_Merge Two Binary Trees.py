# 617. Merge Two Binary Trees

# Definition for a binary tree node.

#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def mergeTrees(self, t1: TreeNode, t2: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        if t1 is None:
            return t2
        if t2 is None:
            return t1
